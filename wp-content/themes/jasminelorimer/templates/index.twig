                        <p>
                            Born and raised in a small town, smack-dab in the centre of Canada, Jasmine grew up immersed in the outdoors. From figure skating, skiing and ice fishing in the winter, to boating, fishing, and hanging out on the dock in the summer, she really lived the full Canadian stereotype. Her love of adventure and quest for new experiences lead her to BC where she developed professionally as a hair stylist, moved to Whistler, and used that as a base to travel the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jasmine was Canadaâ€™s first Bachelorette, which propelled her into the national spotlight, opening up new opportunities to pursue and share her passions.
